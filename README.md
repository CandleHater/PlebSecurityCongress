A time comes in one's life when one must stop and think, examining its situation within the world to see how it is being affected by it in order to see the road ahead. The year 2020 so far posed unprecedented turbulance for many, with governmental overreach of power and the endless printing of money accelerating, more negative events are expected to come.<br>
As we progress forward, ever more apparent it starts to become, that attention at one point or another will eventually focus onto Bitcoin and it's users by those who are in power. Since the avenues to attack Bitcoin are slowly closing in, or even by some considered to be beyond possible, new forms of attacks will start emerging that directly attempt to target the social layer of the bitcoin ecosystem.<br>
<br>
Individuals are simply, not prepared.<br>
<br>
Big government's plans to bring about the control of bitcoin will be an asymmetrical batterfront. Governments around the world will slowly attempt to encircle and then eliminte the power of the sovereign individual who newly managed to regain their freedom throughout the use of Bitcoin. In a few years, national banks within the United States will introduce in custodial storage solutions for bitcoin and with that further bring it under control by capturing a large percentage of its supply. The next logical step for governments is to fully control the movement of bitcoins with more invastive KYC and AML soltuions that will prevent users from withdrawing their funds from exchanges or banks into individual custody.<br>
<br>
One of the next logical step for those in power now is to start attacking us, bitcoiners, in order to render our ability to organize, impossible. By holding the bitcoins under their control and making it impossible for the social layer to organize, it might reach its goal, if we let them.<br>
<br>
This security congress was created here to make it possible for bitcoiners to get informed, get educated and to be able to debate these issues among themselves while reciving valuable input from knowledged individuals among them.<br>
It is important that we start talking about these issues right now, not later.<br>
